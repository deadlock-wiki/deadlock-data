| notes =
* Medic Pack now heal amounts increased by 2x
* Medic Pack heal now splits its value evenly based on the number of nearby [[Heroes|heroes]] (so 1 [[Hero|hero]] is 100%, 2 [[Heroes|heroes]] is 50%, 3 [[Heroes|heroes]] is 33%, etc. Other nearby units also get the reduced values.)
* Medic Pack regen applied over 2s instead of 1s
* Medic Pack ally search radius from 30 to 35
* Medic Pack pickup range scales after 10 minutes (similar to the expiry duration), from 18m at 10 minutes scaling up by 1m per minute up to 26m range.

* [[Walkers]] now have escalating [[Health|health]] after each one dies. From a constant 12880 to 8000/11000/14000 (model scale slightly smaller for 1st and slightly bigger for last)

* {{ItemIcon|Focus Lens}}: [[Cooldown]] increased from 32s to 38s
* {{ItemIcon|Focus Lens}}: Duration reduced from 4.25s to 4s
