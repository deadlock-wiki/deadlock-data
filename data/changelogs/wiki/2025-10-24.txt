* Getting damaged during the initial launch window (0.6s) after using a Jump Pad will cause you to be stunned (similar to [[Ziplines|ziplines]] having an initial knockoff period). When you are stunned, you will lose control and continue towards the landing destination. The [[Stun|stun]] will wear off 0.2s after landing, and then a 30% slow for 2s will apply. [[Damage]] over time does not trigger this (same [[Damage|damage]] rules as [[Ziplines|ziplines]]).
