* Getting damaged during the initial launch window (0.6s) after using a Jump Pad will cause you to be stunned (similar to ziplines having an initial knockoff period). When you are stunned, you will lose control and continue towards the landing destination. The stun will wear off 0.2s after landing, and then a 30% slow for 2s will apply. Damage over time does not trigger this (same damage rules as ziplines).
