[ General ]

* [[Trooper]] bounty [[Mechanics|mechanics]] have been reworked. The first half of the [[Souls|souls]] still fly out as deniable [[Orb|orb]], however rather than the other half being instantly given to nearby players it will fall to the ground as an [[Orb|orb]] that you need to get near to pick up. It has a 18m capture radius where it'll travel to you once you get within. Only one player needs to claim it, share rules remain the same as before.
