* Replaced the recent soul duplication hotfix with new behavior. Pre 10 min, lanes now always split orbs when there are more heroes than the assigned participants for that lane (3+ people in a dual lane, 2+ people in a solo). Previously it only split with 3+ people regardless of the lane, which is what allowed soul abuses when dipping into a solo lane.
* Private lobbies can now assign players to duo and solo lanes
* Fixed some recent bugs with {{HeroIcon|Vindicta}} {{AbilityIcon|Flight}} that could cause some large bursts in a direction
* Fixed being able to shoot while using {{ItemIcon|Ethereal Shift}} and flying with {{HeroIcon|Vindicta}}
* {{ItemIcon|Veil Walker}}: Fire Rate reduced from 30% to 20%
