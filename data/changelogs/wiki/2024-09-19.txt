* Replaced the recent [[Soul|soul]] duplication hotfix with new behavior. Pre 10 min, [[Lanes|lanes]] now always split orbs when there are more [[Heroes|heroes]] than the assigned participants for that lane (3+ people in a dual lane, 2+ people in a solo). Previously it only split with 3+ people regardless of the lane, which is what allowed [[Soul|soul]] abuses when dipping into a solo lane.
* Private lobbies can now assign players to duo and solo [[Lanes|lanes]]
* Fixed some recent bugs with {{HeroIcon|Vindicta}} {{AbilityIcon|Flight}} that could cause some large bursts in a direction
* Fixed being able to shoot while using {{ItemIcon|Ethereal Shift}} and flying with {{HeroIcon|Vindicta}}
* {{ItemIcon|Veil Walker}}: [[Fire Rate]] reduced from 30% to 20%
