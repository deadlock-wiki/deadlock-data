[ General Changes ]

* Bots will now replace a human player if the player has been disconnected for more than 30 seconds ([[Hero|hero]] will retreat home first and then after 30 seconds the bot takes over). After 4 minutes it will start using [[Souls|souls]] to buy [[Items|items]]. During laning phase it will go to its assigned lane, afterwards it will aim to stick near where most allies are located.
