[ General Changes ]

* Matchmaking is now open 24/7 for all regions

* Added new minimap
Updated base asset and added new unique Hero Icons​
Neutral Camps are now represented by a highlight glow on the buildings they are located within​
The Orange Lane (Orchard) is now the Green Lane (Greenwich)​

* Added a new behavior system. Players can temporarily lose access to certain capabilities in the game. The controls include Matchmaking, Voice Chat, Text Chat, Pausing, and Reporting. The system for tracking is active now, however we will wait on most penalties for a few days as we review the results.
* There is now a low priority queue. The primary way to enter this is through abandoning games, but it can include other behavior. You must complete the required amount of games (escalates based on low priority frequency) to be able to return to using matchmaking normally.
* Regularly misreporting players will result in you losing the reporting function and may in some cases cause you to go into low priority as well.

* New players that are queued solo will only match with other new players until they get 4 wins
* The lane allocation of 1-1-2-2- and 2-2-1-1 will no longer be a possible setup
* A 6 player party will no longer match against solo players. This may result in longer queue times for 6 stacks.
* AFK players will be automatically kicked out after a few minutes
* Abandon Match dialog is now more clear about consequences of leaving
* Abandon Match now has a time delay before you can click it to help protect against some accidental cases

* Added custom hotkeys per hero

* {{AbilityIcon|Bounce Pad}} visuals have been replaced with a wind fan (no mechanic changes). The effects also indicate the travel path.
* Added little spirit frog legs to the Soul Urn
* Orange zipline is now green

* Space Bar no longer cancels abilities. Abilities can be pressed again to cancel the ones that have a cancel state.
* The Alternate Cast modes "Modifier Button" and "Alternate Cast Button" have had their behaviors merged
* Added UI button hints when using "Alternate Cast Button" in some extra cases
* Added a slider for Double Tap Alternate Cast timing
* Added a slider for Press and Hold Alternate Cast required time

-Changes to Scoreboard (TAB) and Extra Info (ALT)
Previously there was a lot of crossover between the TAB and ALT modes during gameplay. In this update we have separated the behavior of these two modes to better serve different functions. The keys used for each of these modes can be swapped within Keybinds Settings.​
​
Scoreboard (TAB):​
* Enables cursor mode​
* Displays Scoreboard​
* Displays Damage Summary​
* Allows minimap ping and draw​
​
Extra Info (ALT):​
* No longer enables cursor mode​
* Quick-upgrade Abilities (ie. ALT+1) each of these can be individually remapped​
* Can now more easily map ALT as an Alternate Cast button​
* Displays extra information on HUD (ie. Zipline Speed Boost Cooldown) - we plan to expand upon this in future updates​
​

* Sand Box orb practice area now displays the time in milliseconds that you hit the orb after spawning
