| notes =
* [[Guardians]] now deal 25% more [[Damage|damage]] to [[Troopers|troopers]]
* [[Guardians]] now take 25% more [[Damage|damage]] from [[Troopers|troopers]]/players
* Range to be considered for [[Souls|souls]] reduced by 5m (The way it works now is there are two independent search ranges that gather nearby allied [[Heroes|heroes]] to consider, the first is 50m from the [[Orb|orb]] itself, and the second is 35m from the [[Hero|hero]] that killed the [[Trooper|trooper]]. The change reduces it by 5m on both. )
* [[Respawn]] time at 40 minutes moved to 35 minutes
