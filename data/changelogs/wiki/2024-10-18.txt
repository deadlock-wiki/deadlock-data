Ranked Matchmaking Update:

* We have adjusted the matchmaking schedule to not be split across many different hours throughout the day, primarily to help address queue times. There will now be a wider continuous, but more concentrated, set of hours that it is enabled in. The schedule is now more simplified as well, as there is no more user selection component.
