[ General Changes ]

* Added a new [[Hero|hero]], {{HeroIcon|Viscous}}. He's green.
1722549138302.png


* Improved client performance

* Reworked the [[Hero]] Builds system. Browsing and editing builds now happens within the [[Shop]] UI (accessible via Sandbox or during a normal game). You can create custom categories for [[Items|items]] with unique names and descriptions that can be independently resized and positioned. The interface for browsing builds has also been improved, public builds will now be sorted by popularity (number of favorites). Old builds are incompatible with this system, so they won't be visible in this UI, but we'll have a console command we'll release soon that you can use to print out your older guides if you need them for reference.



* North America (NA) servers have been moved from the west coast to closer to the middle of the country to make latency between east and west coast a little more even, as the majority of users are east coast now. The total average ping amongst all players will be lower as a result of this (a little higher for some and a lot lower for others).
* NA region testing times now start 1 hour earlier weekdays and weekends

* Minimum [[Hero|hero]] roster requirement reduced from 4 to 3

* Added Oceanic servers and matchmaking region. Testing times are displayed in the client

* Added [[Teleporter]] icons on the [[Minimap|minimap]]. The icons glow when you get close to them and pulse on the [[Teleporter|teleporter]]'s exit location to show you the destination when you are about to enter it.



* When using the underground tunnels, the primary [[Minimap|minimap]] fades out and an underground [[Map|map]] for that area shows you your path and the exit locations.



* Reworked the invite system in the client to streamline the process. Emails are no longer required, the users will now receive access directly through Steam and Discord/Forum access will be available through the client. The UI will now also group users into three categories: available to invite, already invited, and already have access. This new system will result in less invitations stuck in limbo, and any previous invites that have not already claimed the game will be granted through this system as well.

* [[Hero]] Sandbox: Added an [[Orb|orb]] spawner for practicing last-hitting orbs
* [[Hero]] Sandbox: Added a dummy [[Hero|hero]] that patrols left and right to practice targeting

* The shooting experience near corners has been improved. Previously if your [[Hero|hero]]'s eyes were obstructed at all, you would be unable to shoot altogether even if a large portion of your body was clearly visible. The check will now be a little more sophisticated and custom per [[Hero|hero]], to allow you to shoot if your body is reasonably exposed. A part of this will also involve your [[Hero|hero]] leaning out a bit if not enough of your model is exposed to enemies.

* [[Soul]] Orbs now fly out in different initial directions before floating up. There is a 1/3rd chance it goes left, 1/3rd chance it goes right, and 1/3rd chance it goes up.
