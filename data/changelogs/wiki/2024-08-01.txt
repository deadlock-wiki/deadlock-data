[ General Changes ]

* Added a new hero, {{HeroIcon|Viscous}}. He's green.
1722549138302.png


* Improved client performance

* Reworked the Hero Builds system. Browsing and editing builds now happens within the Shop UI (accessible via Sandbox or during a normal game). You can create custom categories for items with unique names and descriptions that can be independently resized and positioned. The interface for browsing builds has also been improved, public builds will now be sorted by popularity (number of favorites). Old builds are incompatible with this system, so they won't be visible in this UI, but we'll have a console command we'll release soon that you can use to print out your older guides if you need them for reference.



* North America (NA) servers have been moved from the west coast to closer to the middle of the country to make latency between east and west coast a little more even, as the majority of users are east coast now. The total average ping amongst all players will be lower as a result of this (a little higher for some and a lot lower for others).
* NA region testing times now start 1 hour earlier weekdays and weekends

* Minimum hero roster requirement reduced from 4 to 3

* Added Oceanic servers and matchmaking region. Testing times are displayed in the client

* Added Teleporter icons on the minimap. The icons glow when you get close to them and pulse on the teleporter's exit location to show you the destination when you are about to enter it.



* When using the underground tunnels, the primary minimap fades out and an underground map for that area shows you your path and the exit locations.



* Reworked the invite system in the client to streamline the process. Emails are no longer required, the users will now receive access directly through Steam and Discord/Forum access will be available through the client. The UI will now also group users into three categories: available to invite, already invited, and already have access. This new system will result in less invitations stuck in limbo, and any previous invites that have not already claimed the game will be granted through this system as well.

* Hero Sandbox: Added an orb spawner for practicing last-hitting orbs
* Hero Sandbox: Added a dummy hero that patrols left and right to practice targeting

* Added a checkbox on the startup development dialog to be able to choose to not show it again

* Reworked the location of the Walker on Amber Yellow and Sapphire Purple lanes. They are a little further towards the map edges. Nearby terrain has been reworked as well.
DL_Yellow_changes.png



* The shooting experience near corners has been improved. Previously if your hero's eyes were obstructed at all, you would be unable to shoot altogether even if a large portion of your body was clearly visible. The check will now be a little more sophisticated and custom per hero, to allow you to shoot if your body is reasonably exposed. A part of this will also involve your hero leaning out a bit if not enough of your model is exposed to enemies.

* Soul Orbs now fly out in different initial directions before floating up. There is a 1/3rd chance it goes left, 1/3rd chance it goes right, and 1/3rd chance it goes up.
