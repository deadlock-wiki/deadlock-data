[ General Changes ]

* Added 6 new heroes to Hero Labs, a new experimental hero matchmaking mode. The heroes are {{HeroIcon|Holliday}}, {{HeroIcon|Calico}}, Wrecker, Fathom, Viper and Magician (temp names). The goal of this mode is to invite players to help us in giving hero design feedback while heroes are in very early phases. Most heroes in this mode will have placeholder models, names, effects, etc (some exceptions are older in-dev heroes that had more developed art). They will also sometimes have placeholder/copy-paste abilities for certain slots if that ability slot is still TBD (such as Magician ultimate). There will be a specific hero labs section on the forum to post feedback on these. Heroes in this mode will often be removed, abilities changed, new heroes added, removed heroes re-added, etc. Patch notes for changes to heroes in this mode will be posted on the Hero Labs subforum. This mode will have limited testing hours for now while we gauge activity, in order to ensure faster queue times. You must have at least 50 games played to be able to queue here. If you don't get a new hero selected (since there are less new heroes than there are players), you will be considered higher priority for subsequent matches to get a new hero from your roster selection.

* Added Commends. You can commend players you've enjoyed playing with during the game or in the post-game scoreboard (same places you would report).  The number of commends you've received on each hero will be displayed in your profile.

* Added new character shader to improve player visibility in all areas of the map and experiment with more stylized rendering of character models



* Updated environment lighting and sky

* Missing AP from above is redistributed along souls reward line at similar soul levels that the objectives previously died on average

* Breakables Souls reduced from 35 + 3/min to 30 + 2.5/min

* Urn comeback properties now require an 8% net worth lead to kick in
* Urn pickup locations are the same as before, however now the drop-off locations will be variable based on which team is leading. If there isn't a lead over 8% net worth, then the drop-off location is the same as before. If there is, then the drop-off location will be closer to the losing team's side. The minimap will show where the drop-off location is as usual, as well as an indicator in the world that helps show you where it is.





* If the Urn hasn't been delivered within 90 seconds of pickup time, it now drains your health for 1% of Max HP per second (the timer is per team). Your regen is disabled during this.
