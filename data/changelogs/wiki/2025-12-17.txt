| notes =
* Initial wall jump no longer costs stamina
* Stamina now regenerates faster (from 5s to 4.5s for 1 stamina)
* Removed on bullet hit move slow
* Time delay before sprint starts working after hero/[[Denizen|neutral]] interaction reduced from 4s to 3s
* [[Weakened Patron]] now gains 50% damage reduction if one defender is in the pit and 100% if two or more are (defenders must be in pit for at least 2s for reduction to kick in)
