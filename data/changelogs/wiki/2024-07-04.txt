[ General Changes ]

* Added Asia servers and matchmaking region. Testing times for this region are Mon-Thur 5PM to 3AM and Fri-Sun 3PM to 3AM in China Standard Time (GMT+8).

* Added South America servers and matchmaking region. Testing times for this region are Mon-Thur 5PM to 3AM and Fri-Sun 3PM to 3AM in Atlantic Standard Time (GMT-4).

* Added a new Damage Report feature. You can now open a flyout panel within the [[Shop|shop]] to view a breakdown of your hero's incoming and outgoing damage throughout the course of a match. You can also hover an enemy hero to view a quick breakdown of their key stats and items. The data can be filtered by last respawn, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, 3 minutes, 1 minute, or 30 seconds.

* Reworked the top bar HUD to reduce overall height

* While spectating or watching replays, the game now has a free cursor mode without needing to hold modifiers down (defaulted to on). Can toggle it off while spectating using the 'J' key.
* Minimap now displays dead heroes for 5 seconds after their death

* Reworked the default suggested items for heroes to be much more simple (oriented more strongly for new player onboarding)

* Parties will now be a little more likely to be in the same lane, if there isn't a wide skill gap or other factors preventing it
* All instances of collecting souls (whether claiming your own or denying an opponent) will share the same sound. Being denied a [[Souls|soul]] orb by an enemy will have its own unique sound.
* Fixed the HUD cooldown state thrashing while picking up the {{AbilityIcon|Soul Urn}}
* Fixed {{AbilityIcon|Spectral Wall}} sometimes not spawning depending on the map geometry nearby
* Added descriptive tooltips to Render and Audio options within settings. Render tooltips include an estimate of performance impact where applicable.

* Reduced the end of match delay from 10s to 4s
* Added a shatter sound effect for meleeing the mid boss rejuvenator
* Added ghost models inside the doorways of the juke closets to help clarify which are dead ends

* Added rejuvenator pickup sound
* Minimap now highlights {{AbilityIcon|Soul Urn}} dropoff location
* Updated {{HeroIcon|Wraith}} {{AbilityIcon|Full Auto}} cast sound
* Added audio feedback for environmental damage
* Fixed sounds associated with last hit playing unreliably
* Updated sounds for {{HeroIcon|Wraith}} {{AbilityIcon|Card Trick}} projectile, impact, and when you gain a card
* Added traffic and construction ambient sounds and updated general ambience mix
