* Fixed players being able to exploit [[Soul|soul]] sharing across multiple [[Lanes|lanes]] to earn more [[Souls|souls]] than intended. The way the fix is implemented is that each player can only be considered for an enemy [[Trooper|trooper]] [[Death|death]] event 4 times per wave number during the laning phase.
* Fixed [[Troopers|troopers]] sometimes not dying after doing their [[Death|death]] flash state
* Fixed {{ItemIcon|Unstoppable}} state not preventing [[Fire Rate|fire rate]] reductions
* Fixed {{HeroIcon|Grey Talon}}'s Charge Shot and {{HeroIcon|Vindicta}}'s {{AbilityIcon|Assassinate}} cameras not working properly
