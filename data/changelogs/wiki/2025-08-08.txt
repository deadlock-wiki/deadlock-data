* Rejuv now drops 1 crystal again, with each heavy melee hit granting a credit to the team (up to 3 for first midboss, and 4 for subsequent ones). Everyone on the team gains the buff. Whenever an ally dies, they respawn in place, lose the buff and your team rejuv credits get reduced by 1 (an ally can only consume one rejuv credit). The top bar has a UI indicator for how many rejuv credits remain. When all rejuv credits are used, the buff disappears for everyone.
