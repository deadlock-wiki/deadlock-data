    - Added versioning system to Configs, so that outdated configs are unloaded




[ Misc Gameplay ]

* Added an Extra Competitive option to allow players to control what type of players are placed on their team. If you prefer to play with higher levels of coordination, communication, and competitiveness, then you can use this option to tell the matchmaker to build your team with like-minded allies. This option will sometimes be inactive in scenarios where the pool is very shallow (large portions of Eternus, off peak hours like 5am, extremely long queue, etc.), but otherwise in most normal scenarios the matchmaker will attempt to find you similar players.

* The new Extra Competitive option, Incoming Chat, and Lane Preference (party only) settings are now collected within a 'Queue Options' button on the dashboard below the profile area

* The recent change to increase party size allowed at the top MMR (from 2 to 3) reverted for Eternus and up, but maintained for Ascendant

* The matchmaker will now try to prioritize each team having at least 2 frontliners when it has the option to do so

* Ability Range stat now has diminishing stacking
* Ability Duration stat now has diminishing stacking
* Fire Rate now has a minimum final value of -50%

* Heroes now have +0.5 Sprint
* {{ItemIcon|Sprint Boots}} reduced from +2 Sprint to +1.5
* {{ItemIcon|Enduring Speed}} reduced from +2 Sprint to +1.5

* Carrying [[Urn]] now sets and limits your movespeed to a fixed 13 (this includes things like {{HeroIcon|Ivy}} {{AbilityIcon|Air Drop}}). It no longer provides sprint. The speed cannot be reduced or increased.
* [[Urn]] spawn point now alternates left and right starting with left, rather than being random

* Shooting a [[Trooper|trooper]] on a [[Zipline|zipline]] now causes other [[Trooper|troopers]] near it on the [[Zipline|zipline]] to dismount as well
* Flying over buildings no longer causes you to get zapped, only standing on the building does

* [[Patron]] HP reduced from 10k to 7.5k
* Downed [[Patron]] HP reduced from 18k to 13.5k
* [[Patron]] HP grows by 250/Min starting 20 min
* Downed [[Patron]] HP grows by 450/Min starting 20 min (overall, these are -25% HP at 20 min, 0% at 30 min, and +25% at 40 min)

* Added a tick based souls system that gives the bottom two net worth players on the team a small amount of souls per second. The amount of souls available to distribute to the bottom two players is based on the souls gathered by your team (2% and 1%). This occurs after the laning phase.

* Added new limiting function for the [[Souls|soul]] orb duplication abuses during the laning phase. You shouldn't experience any real difference in normal gameplay:
    Players can only participate in 4 [[Soul Orb]] share events per [[Trooper|trooper]] wave, before being declared lower priority. A low priority player is not counted for when deciding how many souls to generate. Example: if a player is near 4 [[Trooper|troopers]] from Wave 1 when they die, then moves to a different lane that has an allied hero still fighting Wave 1 [[Trooper|troopers]], that player will no longer cause the wave to double the souls generated as is the case now, as they are considered a low priority player for that wave. The generated Souls will then be split as normal.

* Reverted a few changes recently related to [[Souls|soul]] duplication issues
    - Reverted: - [[Guardian|Guardians]] now deal 25% more damage to [[Trooper|troopers]]
    - Reverted: - [[Guardian|Guardians]] now take 25% more damage from [[Trooper|troopers]]/players
